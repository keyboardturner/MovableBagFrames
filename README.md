# MovableBagFrames
Allows the Dragonflight bag frames to be resizeable and movable.

<p>Currently all bag frames can't be moved or resized. This addons attempts to allow removing and resizing both the combined bags and separate bags, as well as the other bank tabs.</p>
<h4>This addon comes with the risk of having taint issues. Although I haven't run into any yet and have tried my best to make workarounds to every single one, I can't guarantee that I've squashed every single instance of it occurring. Usually it happens when the bags are automatically opened by something.</h4>
<p>If you run into any issues, please list the steps you took to reproduce this issue.</p>
<p>There's a few known weird occurrences that aren't taint when the bags kind of resize and stretch themselves when you click individual bag buttons. Closing and opening the bags should usually fix the issue.</p>
